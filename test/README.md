This test folder is just a convinience folder to store the current problem Solution class

Its good to integrate with VSCode Java Language server and Java Debugger

// .vscode/launch.json
{
    "configurations": [
        {
            "type": "java",
            "name": "Debug (Launch) - Current File",
            "request": "launch",
            "mainClass": "Solution.java"
        }
    ]
}
